## Order and Customer Management System with Stack MEAN 
**Description**📝

The project "Order and Customer Management System" is a web application developed using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js) with a focus on order and customer management for a specific business, taking as reference the McDonald's Ecuador website.

## Main Features💡
1. User Authentication and Registration: The system has a security module that allows users to register and log into the platform using a username and password. This guarantees secure access to the system's functionalities (For demonstration purposes, a menu button was added to the Navbar to access the system's functionalities).

2. Customer Management: The system allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on customer data. Users can add new customers, view details of existing customers, update information and delete customer records as required.

3. Order Management: Users can create and manage orders placed by customers. The system allows adding products and/or services to the order, specifying quantities, prices and any other relevant information. In addition, order editing and deletion operations can be performed.

4. Product Management: The system offers a module to manage the products available in the business. Users can add new products, update existing information, delete products that are no longer available and view a complete list of products with their details.

5. Intuitive User Interface: The user interface design is inspired by the  [McDonald's Ecuador](https://www.mcdonalds.com.ec/) website, providing a pleasant and familiar experience to users. Attractive visual elements and an intuitive design are used to facilitate navigation and use of the application.

6. Data Persistence: The system uses MongoDB as the database to store and manage customer data, orders, products and other related elements. This ensures an efficient data structure and easy scalability.

## Technologies used📱
1. **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used to store the data.
2. **Express:** Backend framework used to create the REST API.
3. **Angular:** Frontend framework used to create the user interface.
4. **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment used to run the backend.
5. **JavaScript:** Programming language used for client and server-side logic.
6. **HTML:** Markup language used to structure and present web content.
7. **Bootstrap:** CSS framework used to quickly and efficiently design and style the user interface.

These technologies together form the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), which provides a solid set of tools for the development of modern and scalable web applications.

The use of these technologies in the project allows taking advantage of a flexible and scalable database such as MongoDB, the ease of API development with Express, the creation of interactive and responsive user interfaces with Angular, and efficient backend execution with Node.js. In addition, JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap are fundamental to the implementation of the logic, structure and design of the web application.

By combining these technologies, you get a complete and powerful development environment to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with user registration and login functionalities, multi-table data consumption and an attractive design based on the McDonald's Ecuador website.

The use of these technologies demonstrates your mastery of a modern technological stack in demand in the industry, which can be a strong point for your professional profile and increase your chances of being hired.
